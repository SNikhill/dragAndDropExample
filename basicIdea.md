# Basic Idea

The webpage has been divided into certain drop zones. These are the zones where the draggable elements [Defined Later] will be dropped to.
Draggable elements are basically normal HTML elements that have a draggable attribute. These elements are basically powered up by: **HTML Drag and Drop API**.

## Defining **Memory**

Each dropzone has been allocated a '_memory_'. This means that each of them will remember what kind of element has been dropped into them.

Then, the combined memory of each of these drop zones could be saved to a database and later retrieved when the user log-ins.
